# GitFocus 🛡️

**Brutally simple productivity and distraction blocking.**

GitFocus is a desktop application designed to help you enter and maintain a flow state. It combines a Pomodoro timer with a ruthless distraction blocker and a visual activity log to keep you accountable.



## ✨ Features

-   **🍅 Pomodoro Timer**: Rigid work/break cycles to maintain focus. Includes a **Mini Mode** and **Taskbar Integration** so you never lose track of your time.
-   **🚫 Aggressive Blocking**: Configure rules to block websites and applications. GitFocus will warn you and fail your session if you persist.
-   **📊 Usage Analytics**: Track your digital habits with detailed insights on total screen time, context switches, and top applications.
-   **📋 Kanban Plan**: Integrated task management to organize your workflow and align your sessions with your goals.
-   **🔥 Activity Heatmap**: Visualize your productivity with a GitHub-style contribution graph. Every successful session is a "commit" to your personal growth.
-   **💻 Developer-First UI**: A brutalist, terminal-inspired aesthetic designed for deep work.
-   **🔒 Privacy First**: All data is stored locally on your machine using SQLite. No cloud servers, no tracking.

## 📥 Download & Installation

You can download the latest version from the **[Releases Page](https://github.com/faisal004/electron/releases)**.

> **Note:** GitFocus is currently available for **Windows only**. macOS and Linux support is coming soon.

### ⚠️ A Note on Windows Installation

When you install GitFocus on Windows, you might see a scary blue warning explicitly saying **"Windows protected your PC"** (SmartScreen).

**This is normal.** It happens because this is an open-source project and I haven't paid for an expensive code-signing certificate yet.

**To install:**
1.  Click **"More info"** on the warning screen.
2.  Click **"Run anyway"**.

The application is safe. You can verify this yourself by checking the source code right here in this repository.

## 🛠️ Built With & Safety

GitFocus is built for transparency and reliability.

-   **End-to-End Type Safe**: Built with TypeScript from the database to the UI, ensuring the application is robust and crash-resistant.
-   **Open Source**: The entire codebase is available for audit. Nothing is hidden.
-   **Offline-Ready**: Your data never leaves your device.
